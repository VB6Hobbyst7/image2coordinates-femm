# image2coordinates-femm
A Matlab toolbox that convert images in plots to use in the FEMM program. The toolbox was developed by Marco Aur√©lio de Oliveira Moreira. Universidade Federal de Santa Catarina - GRUCAD (https://grucad.ufsc.br/). If you have any doubts or suggestions, please contact me in: marcoaomoreira@gmail.com

The user have to  install FEMM 4.2 in the computer (http://www.femm.info/wiki/Download) and after that make sure to put the path ot the femm in this code. (Generally the path is ~FEMM42\femm42\mfiles). In the first part of the toolbox that connects with the manual part and calculates the automatic part, is where you have to put this path.

I uploaded a file Examples with two examples of the application of the toolbox.

If in some way, you see a code or part of the code that I didn't referece, please let me know.
